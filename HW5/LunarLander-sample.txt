LUNAR LANDER INSTRUCTIONS

You are landing on the moon and have taken over manual
control 1000 feet above a good landing spot. You have a
downward velocity of 50 feet/sec. 150 units of fuel remain.

Here are the rules that govern your APOLLO space-craft:
(1) After each second, the height, velocity, and remaining
    fuel will be reported via DIGBY, your on-board computer.
(2) After each report, enter the number of units of fuel you
    wish to burn during the next second. Each unit of fuel
    will slow your descent by 1 foot/sec.
(3) The maximum thrust of your engine is 30 feet/sec/sec or
    0 units of fuel per second.
(4) When you contact the lunar surface, your descent engine
    will automatically shut down and you will be given a
    report of your landing speed and remaining fuel.
(5) If you run out of fuel, you will no longer be prompted
    to enter the number of units to burn each second. Your
    second by second reports will continue until you contact
    the lunar surface.
